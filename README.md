Dog-years-iOS-
==============

This is a simple iOS app whihc I created just to learn some basics in Objective-C.
The app calculates the human years of a dog, given its original dog years.
The user will be asked to enter the original dog years.
The calculation formula can be understood by googling.
I have implemented that formula in Objective-C and added some images and storyboard content.
